# Design Patterns and Good Practices
During this module we are going to focus on how two very important topics.
1. Good practices
2. Design Patterns

## Good practices :
By good practices we mean practices that will improve the way you write and read code, and the way that others will understand your code and intent. By doing this you will make sure that in time your code will be as clean as possible. This means that in time you will need less code (that will also be easier to read) to write the same thing as when you were starting out. Sounds exciting, right?

## Design patterns :
By design patterns we mean a series of ways in which we can structure code to better perform certain tasks while keeping code reusability high.
It also means doing particular things in a standardized fashion so that when other people see your code they'll understand what you wanted to do.
